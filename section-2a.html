<h2 class="stop" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>
Wacquant’s article discusses the systematic and generational outcomes caused by industrialization and neighborhoods of poverty. He discusses advanced marginality, a term used to define poverty that is sustained by structural issues, territorial stigma, and abandonment of neighborhoods.  
</p>
<p>The article connects to themes about structural racism, suburbanization, and urban renewal discussed in class and other class adjacent resources.</p>


<h2 class="stop" id="capitalist">Capitalist Racism</h2>
<p>
Wacquent calls out the regime for producing pockets of poverty and economic inequality. He says that these pockets are founded in fragmented wage-labor relationships, technological advancements that leave neighborhoods unemployed, and the disconnection between neighborhoods and the larger economy. 
</p>

<p>
This connects directly to Soja’s “It All Comes Together in Los Angeles." These three factors are directly connected to capitalism and industrialization. The wage-labor relationships are influenced by increasing manufacturing jobs that moved to the West that created pockets of populations. Additionally, advancing technologies describe the causes that caused manufacturing factories to shut down and leave those neighborhoods unemployed.  These pockets were then disconnected from the larger LA and area surrounding it. Wacquent goes into more depth about capitalism and helps explain the relationships described in Soja’s article.
</p>
<p>Wacquent also describes the “loss of hinterland” which leads to communities unraveling. In earlier eras, he describes how displaced workers could rely on kin networks, neighborhood institutions, churches, or informal economies. But now, marginalized communities can no longer support each other because the entire social and economic stability has collapsed. </p>
<p>This is seen in the rust-belt neighborhoods in LA which were then succumbed to gang violence, which still persist today.</p>
<p>This also related to the City of God where the favela became disconnected from the larger urban cities. This led to generations of violence and gangs leading the community. The neighborhoods had been removed from the national economic life and left in poverty. </p>

<h2 class="stop" id="hinterland">Territorial Stigmatization and Urban Renewal</h2>
<p>
Another interesting argument made by Wacquent is the stigma associated with neighborhoods: territorial stigmatization. He discusses how residents of that area are afraid to tell people where they live and how certain neighborhoods become shameful. 
</p>

<p>
Additionally, he notes how this shame becomes fully ingrained when public officials also start referring to these neighborhoods as “bad” and assign it territorial stigma. This solidifies further structural issues in the area including divestment and a lack of public services to support the community. 
</p>

<p>
This directly relates to Woocher’s “LA’s War on Public Housing: An Introduction.”  In the beginning of the article, Woocher describes how Daryl Gates, the police chief of the LAPD, said he wanted to blow up the projects. This represented the anti-public housing sentiment that rose in LA by wealthy individuals. 
</p>
<p>Wacquant also describes how these neighborhoods are seen as problems to be solved, similar to Woocher’s description. Wacquant describes urban renewal programs that forcibly dismantle stigmatized neighborhoods. For example, he notes how Porto, Portugal used territorial stigma to justify mass police raids and redevelopment.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Oakland Museum special exhibition explored urban renewal projects in Oakland and Hayward. Russell City in Hayward became an unincorporated region in Hayward which was then procured by the government because it was deemed unsuitable, despite it being a large community of Black and Latino residents. </p>
<p>These renewal projects turned into private projects that, again, tie into the theme of capitalism and ownership of land. Governments use stigma and incentives for privatization to justify urban renewal projects instead of supporting the communities. </p>


<h2 class="stop" id="resistance">Collective Resistance</h2>
<p>A unique take from Wacquant is that communities become individualist and community members cannot rely on each other for help if everyone is helpless. However, examples in class describe the exact opposite. </p>
<p>For example, Perry’s “The Gendered Racial Logic of Spatial Exclusion” in Black Women Against the Land Grab: The Fight for Racial Justice in Brazil describes women coming together to understand how urban planning has impacted social and economic involvement and mobility across Salvador. </p>
<p>This short documentary we watched in class showing these communities gathering to have discussion and work on creating community gardens shows the movement to spark change.</p>
<p>Additionally, we also saw Moms 4 Housing fought for de-privitization and the right to housing in Oakland. Despite being unhoused themselves, they went out of their way to make a point and fight for housing as a right. </p>
<p>However, I think these examples are only a few. Many neighborhoods are likely to succumb to the capitalistic pressure and become individualistic. The case studies Wacquant discusses shows the other outcome of stigmatization. </p>
<p>This comparison has emphasized the bravery and importance of feminism in fighting for equitable urban planning. Despite the opportunity to become individualistic, these examples show how women think beyond themselves and care about their children and community. </p>

<h2 class="stop" id="reflection">Final Reflection</h2>
<p>Wacquant’s work is very relevant to this course and its conversations. It provides more insights and case studies of suburbanization and poverty becoming ingrained with urban planning and neighborhoods. It connects the themes of this class more to urban planning and capitalism playing a role in urban development. </p>
