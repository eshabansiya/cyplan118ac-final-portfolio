<h2 class="stop" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>
San Francisco's anti-homelessness sweeps are a current event that aligns with the themes of capitalism, urban planning, and territorial stigmatization. These sweeps intensified under Mayor London Breed and continued under the current Mayor Daniel Lurie who came into office in 2025. These policies reflect capitalist ideals, the privatization of public spaces, and stigmatizing unhoused communities.
</p>


<h2 class="stop" id="criminalization">Criminalization Over Housing</h2>
<p>
In April 2024, Mayor London Breed announced the city would begin very aggressive” encampment sweeps
across neighborhoods such as the Tenderloin and SoMa (SF Chronicle).  
Despite more than 8,000 unhoused residents, Breed stated that the city did not plan to build additional housing 
or expand shelter capacity. Instead, the policy centered on police enforcement and forced relocations.
</p>

<p>
Breed cited the 2024 Supreme Court ruling that overturned San Frasnsico’s ruling that protected unhoused individuals from criminalizations as a help in passing this policy. Breed called it a “tool that empowered cities” to clear the streets.
</p>

<p>
This aligns with the neoliberal idea that once governments deem a community unworthy, they will no longer support or invest in their wellbeing. Additionally, the lack of open public restrooms at night show how public amenities are designed for consumers and tourists and not the residents.
</p>


<h2 class="stop" id="container">Territorial Stigmatization</h2>
<p>
The Mission Local photojournalism on encampment sweeps shows the emotional and spatial violence of these operations: tents being thrown away, people pushed from block to block, and police standing over residents who have nowhere to go (Mission Local). 
</p>

<p>
Many interviewees describe the streets and overcrowded shelters as “containers” they cannot escape. More importantly, they are isolating spaces that prevent residents from building meaningful social relationships, which further deteriorates their mental health. 
</p>

<p>
This connects to territorial stigmatization, as the unhoused population is deemed unworthy of support and public officials refuse to actively support their needs. Because unhoused people are criminalized, they do not trust the police. Interactions with officers and sweeps can lead to loss of ID documents, confiscation of medication, and displacement from support services in their area. This prevents them from receiving help from public social services if they are accompanied by police. 
</p>


<h2 class="stop" id="hostile">Hostile Architecture</h2>
<p>
One of the clearest examples of capitalist urban planning is in its evident hostile architecture that makes public spaces unenjoyable for any resident. Local businesses installed large metal planters on sidewalks to prevent unhoused residents from setting up their tents. San Francisco is also known for its spikes across structures, bars in the middle of benches, or slanted surfaces. 
</p>

<p>
Some of these planter boxes violate city codes as they do not have a permit, but the city rarely removes them. This suggests that the city turns a blind eye to private interference with homelessness because they do not truly care about improving unhoused resident’s conditions.
</p>

<p>
Homeowners even describe how they want to “protect their investment” and how they deserve to have clean, empty sidewalks if they pay millions for their homes. This directly aligns with the idea that housing and cleanliness is not a right and must be bought; only wealthy people deserve or can afford safe and clean spaces to live.
</p>

<p>This capitalism shapes the residents of San Francisco and their values. We can see this just in the fact that Mayor Londen Breed and Mayor Daniel Lurie were elected. Residents want a crackdown on homelessness so they can enjoy their own clean streets and protect their property value.</p>


<h2 class="stop" id="publicspace">Anti-Human Public Spaces</h2>
<p>
Similarly, Civic Center and Union Plaza, hubs for businesses and a mall, have seen a large removal of public benches (Curbed). These removals are an obvious example of hostile infrastructure and architecture to prevent unhoused residents from sleeping or resting on them.
</p>

<p>
Union Square is known to invite tourists, shoppers, and wealthy residents who engage in consumerism for private companies. The removal of public seating and public patios or commercial spaces were caused by the Union Square Business Improvement District (BID), which used private capital to reshape public spaces to benefit businesses.
</p>

<p>However, the lack of these public spaces make Union Square less enjoyable for everyone, not just unhoused residents. </p>


<h2 class="stop" id="resistance">Community Resistance</h2>
<p>
However, there are efforts to improve public spaces and capture the stories on unhoused individuals. The Mission Local photojournalism is one example. The community-driven initiatives, Public Bench Project, is another example. The project came from a want to have a bench around every corner so residents could enjoy their city. 
</p>

<p>
These installations encourage residents to sit and gather. These initiatives show how there are community members who are against the privatization of urban planning and take over of the city.
