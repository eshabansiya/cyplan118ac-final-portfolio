<h2 class="stop" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>
I really enjoyed both <em>City of God</em> and the video we watched in class, 
<span style="font-weight:bold">“I Was There When House Took Over.”</span>
Although they focus on different places and different eras, both pieces show how people create 
joy, community, and survival strategies within environments of systemic violence, neglect, and stigma.
</p>

<p>
City of God was a beautiful movie. It has such a natural pace that allows us to see the gradual growth and changes in the characters and village. The film made us care deeply about every character despite their involvement in the gang violence. One of the most powerful aspects of the film is how it makes every character human. Even those involved in gang violence are shown with vulnerability and how they were shaped by their experiences and circumstances.</p>
<p>The cinematography helps enforce this humanity. Each shot places us in a different perspective, literally: a child, a bystander, a gang member. This gives so much more meaning to violence and living in a village that is governed by gangs.</p>
<p>The final shot, when Rocket takes a photo of Lil Ze after the police kill him, was especially compelling. This picture is what gets him out of the village. For the entire movie, we watch Rocket try to avoid the violence surrounding him. He simply observes and photographs it all. This passion helped him leave and create an avenue for himself. </p>
<p>What made the film even more powerful was learning that it was based on a true story. I was especially moved when the real news clips that the movie recreated came up. The movie doesn’t blame individual characters for the violence. </p>
<p>Instead, it points to the systematic issues that keep the village run with violence: corrupt police who take bribes, a government that neglects the community, and social conditions that trap the residents. Knowing that these events truly happened, and that the movie is told through the lens of Rocket,makes it incredibly moving.</p>

<h2 class="stop" id="disco">“I Was There When Disco Was Invented”</h2>
<img src="images/thewarehouse.png" alt="The Warehouse" class="essay-image">
<p>I found the video, “I Was There When House Was Invented,” really interesting and informative. I had always associated disco with white hippies and shiny disco balls in the 80s. However, learning that disco was created and popularized by Black residents in New York City and Chicago was very shocking and made me realize how much cultural erasure happens.
</p>
<p>
I realized I had fallen for the propaganda. Black music and cultural movements often get claimed by white audiences as their own. I thought I was aware of these patterns, but seeing it in disco too made me realize that I am not immune to the rewriting of these stories. It made me want to learn more about other popular cultural movements Black residents brought and popularized. 
</p>
<p>The video also showed how disco was used as a social movement to bring joy and liberation for the Black, Latino, and queer community. These disco clubs were an escape and safe space.
</p>
<p>I was also very surprised with how intensely white residents hated disco, and how their hatred has actually formed into organized movements as seen in the baseball game. Especially because the creation of disco isn’t so far back, it is so shocking that that kind of hatred was still prevalent in recent history. 
</p>
<p>I also really enjoyed the interviews with people who were actually there during the riots, police raids, and disco chaos that popularized the disco. 
</p>


<h2 class="stop" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Both these pieces are about the survival strategies in chaos — photography and disco. This shows how black spaces and minority spaces are created in times of violence and hatred, and how joy still exists.
