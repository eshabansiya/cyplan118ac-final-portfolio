<p>
The video “San Francisco Cleans Up the Streets for APEC 2023” (ABC7 News) shows a specific example of anti-homelessness and the prioritization of capitalism in San Francisco.

The new clip shows and describes how in the weeks leading up to the 2023 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, San Francisco swept the homeless encampments a couple blocks around where the summit was being hosted. The clean was done to make the city presentable for world leaders and global corporations.

The second video shows Governor Gavin Newsom whether the cleanup was timed specifically for APEC. He said:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2rem; font-style: italic;">
“I know folks say, ‘Oh, they’re just cleaning up this place because all those fancy leaders are coming.’  
That’s true, because it’s true.”
</p>

<p>
This is an explicit tell that the city only cares about making the city presentable to these leaders and businesspeople who can invest and support capitalism in the city. Newsom’s quote reveals that the unhoused population does not receive support unless elites make it necessary.
</p>


<h2 class="stop" id="stigma">Territorial Stigma</h2>
<p>
It shows how territorial stigma shapes the city, and that the city officials did not want to seem dirty or dangerous in front of these leaders. 
</p>

<p>
The efforts shown in the clip do not address homelessness but intend to cover it up and hide it. While they had short term solutions by adding 300 shelter beds as shelters reached capacity, this only started the day of APEC. After APEC many people returned back to the streets. 
</p>
<p>The city was curating public space for investment not for actual residents. </p>
<p>Additionally, the speed at which the streets were cleaned shows that the argument that solving homelessness is too costly does not hold up. The city was able to procure the resources needed just to maintain their image.</p>
<p>This shows that the fight against homelessness in San Francisco is more about which residents are valued, and their value is determined by how wealthy they are. </p>
