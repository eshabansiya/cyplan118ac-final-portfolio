<p>This shows how the city has made the sidewalks difficult to walk by, simply to prevent encampments from reforming. It is also a powerful image because this sidewalk used to be someone’s home, however, it now remains empty and inaccessible to any resident. This shows how these policies impact all residents and makes the city more anti-human.</p>

This image is really powerful because it shows how quickly the land and streets can get taken over. Similarly, it is interesting to think that just a few weeks ago, people were living on these streets, and now instead, a man sells food. The streets are capitalized on — as either a home or place for businesses. This shows how capitalism has influenced our perception of space as a place to claim and make something out of.</p>
