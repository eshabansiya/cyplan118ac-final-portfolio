<p>I recently declared the City Planning Minor over the summer, so this was the first City Planning class I have taken. While I had expected it to be about policy and planning, I am happy that I had the chance to learn more about the experiences of a city and the effect of planning. </p>
<p>In general I have viewed city planning as a very powerful tool, but one that IS focused on the residents. However, this class has made me realize how past planning continues to affect communities today, and how planning today continues to harm marginalized communities.</p>
<p>I think I am not more passionate about city planning because of the power it holds. I see cities and the right to live as a valuable right that should be protected. I think it has also made me think more critically about different communities' life experiences and how people live and fight through these experiences.</p>
<p>This class was really impactful as it allowed me to read about and truly reflect about various experiences with my classmates and also listen to discussions in class. It is one thing to know about the power city planning how, and it's another to see how it has been misused and truly harmed communities.</p>
<p>My biggest takeaway was how intertwined capitalism is with urban planning. More than just the value in land, capitalism has built cities around the value in people as human capital. Cities are built around working and industries, not living. Infrastructure, such as prisons, are built to keep residents fearful and in-line. Housing, which should be a human right, is owned by private companies without any interest for the residents who cannot affort it. </p>
<p>Working on this portfolio has also helped me bridge the themes between different pieces. As I was writing I realized how one idea was randomly connected to a previous reading we had done. </p>
<p>This is reflected in the poem I wrote below about capitalism and planning decide areas that are worthy and when they are valuable.</p>

<h2 class="stop-poem" id="poem">Boxed</h2>

<p>
We are born into a box.<br>
A block.<br>
A single street.
</p>

<p>
Numbered. Zoned.<br>
Outlined in red on a map<br>
we can only see but not touch
</p>

<p>
Each street divided<br>
and labeled
</p>

<p>
We are labeled.<br>
We are our street.<br>
We are our block.<br>
We are our box.
</p>

<p>
We learn to call it home.<br>
Learn the cracks in the sidewalk,<br>
the potholes to avoid,
the ones that never get filled.
</p>

<p>
We make the most of the dirt and mud.<br>
The blinking streetlights.<br>
The liquor store with bulletproof glass.<br>
The bus that comes late,<br>
but still comes.
</p>

<p>
People make the most.<br>
Others take the most.<br>
Some decide they are in charge:<br>
running the streets,<br>
the block,<br>
the box<br>
calling it order,<br>
calling it safety,<br>
calling it discipline.
</p>

<p>
But it’s the only discipline we have.
</p>

<p>
There is a world outside the box.<br>
But they don’t see us.
</p>

<p>
Not when the water pipes burst.<br>
Not when the school closes.<br>
Not when the factory shuts down<br>
and leaves behind silence and rust.
</p>

<p>
So we manage.
</p>

<p>
Nothing of value, they say.<br>
But we call it home.
</p>

<p>
Until one day,<br>
the block becomes valuable.
</p>

<p>
The streets we stand on.<br>
The dirt under our feet.<br>
The same land they ignored<br>
suddenly has a price per square foot.
</p>

<p>
When the world outside<br>
runs out of empty boxes,<br>
they peer into ours.
</p>

<p>
They see the dirt and<br>
call it blight.<br>
They see the people and<br>
call them the problem.
</p>

<p>
They say the box has potential.<br>
They say it needs cleaning.<br>
But they can make it work.
</p>

<p>
You hold onto the street,<br>
the dirt,<br>
the earth.
</p>

<p>
But they shake you out.<br>
Eviction notices like threats.<br>
Police raids like parades.
</p>

<p>
They pull away everyone,<br>
until it’s just you.
</p>

<p>
So you find a new box.<br>
A new block.<br>
A new street.
</p>

<p>
You try to call it home.
</p>

<p>
But before you can,<br>
the world comes back.
</p>

<p>
They ran out of empty boxes again.
</p>

<p>
So you run back to the only place you know,<br>
But you don’t recognize the box anymore.
</p>

<p>
Its lined with succulents and palm trees.
</p>

<p>
A juice bar on the corner<br>
selling pressed leaves for fifteen dollars.
</p>

<p>
The dirt is gone.<br>
Replaced with polished concrete.<br>
The air smells like pine.<br>
</p>

<p>
They cut a ribbion, bragging about the new city.<br>
And all the new residents clap and cheer
</p>

<p>
And you realize,
</p>

<p>
now you know
</p>

<p>
The box,<br>
The block,<br>
Your home, was never yours
