<h2 class="stop" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>Before engaging with these readings, I knew that Los Angeles was a sprawling, car-dependent city with difficult mobility. However, I did not fully know how LA became like this, and how the sprawling form connected to rising capitalism and industrialization. Readings from Soja, Davis, and Weaver described these understandings in depth.</p>

<h2 class="stop" id="cleanup">LA's Foundation: Captalism</h2>
<p>I have had the impression that capitalism was currently at its worst, and while industrialization contributed to poor living conditions, I did not understand the extent to which capitalism had on recent city developments — as seen in LA.  </p>

<p>I had not known that LA originated from industries (agriculture, oil, and manufacturing) that attracted immigrants and settlers. While I knew the Bay Area attracted Gold Rush settlers, I did not consider how the overall West Coast settlement influenced LA. I also did not realize how much industry played in the settlers' suburbanization. 
</p>
<p>Settlers moving to LA during industrialization caused uneven clusters surrounding these industries — many of which died down and left the cities they supported vulnerable. This movement and population growth specifically surrounding industries caused LA to not have a single center area. </p>

<p>
LA wasn’t built to be a city — it was built to be an industry, and it treated its residents as such. Rising capitalism allowed private companies to exploit residents. Often, this was wealthy white residents exploiting low-wage people of color — an influence that is still seen today. 
</p>

<h2 class="stop" id="capitalism">Deindustrialization and Segregation</h2>
<p>LA’s gang violence and racial enclaves are well known, however, I had not considered how they had come to be. Soja describes how diminishing industries left certain cities in a rustbelt area with high unemployment, abandoned factories, and decreasing investment. 
</p>
<p>
These economic shifts correlated with racial segregation and poverty that shaped gang violence. On top of these shifts, the city did not attempt to support its residents. Instead, the city viewed these areas as unimportant — building highways and deliberately pushing racial minorities into these neighborhoods to make space for wealthy suburbs.
</p>

<h2 class="stop" id="stigma">Cars as a Symbol</h2>
<p>While I know that car-dependency is a choice influenced by capitalism, I did not realize how much it affected life and mobility prior to the modern era. I always blamed car-dependency on oil companies lobbying for more highways over transportation, so that residents would have to rely on cars and gas. 
</p>
<p>
However, these readings show a larger image of car-dependency in LA. Car-dependency in LA was also a means of segregating individuals into their own clusters, and making mobility difficult and inconvenient. It also made mobility expensive and a privilege. All themes that connect to the industrialization that led to suburbanization and lack of mobility. 
</p>
<p>
This explanation makes more sense and builds off my initial understanding of car-dependency in LA. 
</p>

<h2 class="stop" id="conclusion">Private Surveillance</h2>
<p>Mike Davis’s “Fortress L.A.” shifted my thinking as well. I had always associated surveillance states with authoritarian governments, but the reading describes how surveillance had become privatized and utilized by white wealthy residents. From gated communities to intentional infrastructure exclusion — anti-homeless design, private police forces, controlled public spaces — the wealthy shape the city to keep others out and concentrate security around themselves 
</p>
<p>
While Soja’s reading informs how clusters formed, Davis’s reading describes how the wealthy exacerbated these issues and continued to segregate LA. 
</p>

<h2 class="stop" id="urban">Urban Crisis</h2>
<p>Weaver’s term “urban crisis” helped me understand how narratives about cities become political tools. The term of “urban crisis” has repeatedly been used to justify specific policy agendas — especially the shift toward neoliberalism. Weaver shows how the concept moved from describing structural issues (slum housing, deindustrialization) to blaming culture, morality, and especially Black Americans for their own decline.
</p>
<p>
It was interesting how Weaver described how certain populations are labeled the problem, allowing policymakers to not feel the need to address the problem with actionable policy. This relates to LA becoming a place of privatized spatial inequality, where the government does not feel the need to address the needs that they claim are caused by the residents themselves.  
</p>

<h2 class="stop" id="urban">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, these readings made me realize how deeply the past continues to shape Los Angeles. These readings and dives into the history of capitalism, industrialization, and suburbanization have defined the initial and likely final layout of LA. 
</p>
<p>
LA continues to face problems with car-dependence, fragmented and segregated neighborhoods, labor exploitation, and a move towards privatization overall. 
</p>
<p>
LA is one of the cities people dream about and want to flock to. However, these desires are based on the ultimate wealthy images of LA and how wealthy residents in LA have capitalized off other residents, in both the past and present. 
</p>
<p>
These readings have made me reflect on the past that has shaped every city's urban planning. Especially in the West Coast where large urban cities are relatively newer and have developed alongside the industrial revolution, large waves of migration, and fights for racial equity.
